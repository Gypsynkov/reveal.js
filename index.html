	<p style=" color: yellow">The basis of Scrum is Sprint, during which work on the product is performed.
		 At the end of Sprint, a new working version of the product should be received.
		 Sprint is always limited in time (1-4 weeks) and has the same duration
		  throughout the life of the product.</p>

							<h3 style=" color: yellow">Sprint Planning</h3>
							<img width="250" height="200" src="assets/Planning.PNG" alt="Planning">
							<p>Before each Sprint starts, Sprint Planning is performed, on which the content of the Product Backlog is evaluated and the Sprint
								 Backlog is formed, which contains the tasks (Story, Bugs, Tasks)
								  that must be completed in the current sprint.</p>

				<h1 style=" color: yellow">Important, often forgotten features:</h1>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scrum is applied incorrectly or incompletely.</li>
						<li>The importance of working to ensure team motivation is underestimated.</li>
						<li>Scrum is used for a product whose requirements are contrary to Scrum's ideology.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

			</section>
			<section>
				<section style="background-image: url(assets/image.jpg); background-size: cover ; color: yellow ;">

					<h1 style=" color: yellow">Advantages</h1>
					<p>1.
						Scrum has quite attractive advantages.
						Scrum is customer oriented, responsive.
						Scrum gives the customer the ability to make changes
						to requirements at any given time (but does not guarantee that these
						changes will be implemented). The ability to change requirements
						is attractive to many software customers.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section style="background-image: url(assets/image.jpg); background-size: cover ;  color: yellow"">
					<p>
						2. Scrum is quite easy to learn, it allows you to save time by
						eliminating non-critical activities. Scrum allows you to get a potentially
						working product at the end of each Sprint.
						Scrum focuses on a self-organizing, multi-functional team that can solve the
						necessary tasks with minimal coordination. This is especially attractive for
						small companies and startups, as it eliminates the need for hiring or training
						specialized personnel for managers.
					</p>

			<section >
				<section style="background-image: url(assets/image.jpg); background-size: cover ; color: yellow ;">

					<h1 style=" color: yellow">Disadvantages</h1>
					<p>1.
							Due to its simplicity and minimalism,
							 Scrum sets a small number of fairly strict rules.
							  However, this conflicts with the idea of customer focus in principle,
							   since the internal rules of the development team are not important to the client,
								especially if they limit the client. For example, if necessary, by the decision of the Sprint client,
								 the backlog can be changed, despite the apparent contradiction with the Scrum rules.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section style="background-image: url(assets/image.jpg); background-size: cover ; color: yellow ;">
					<p>
						2. Another weak feature of Scrum is its emphasis on a self-organizing,
						 multi-functional team. With the apparent reduction in the cost of coordinating the team,
						  this leads to an increase in the costs of selecting personnel,
						   their motivation, and training. Under certain labor market conditions,
						    the formation of a full-fledged, effective Scrum team may not be possible.
